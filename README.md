# 🧠 Quiz Application Microservices

A scalable and modular Quiz Application built using Spring Boot and a Microservices Architecture.
It leverages Service Discovery (Eureka) and API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) for robust, dynamic service communication and a unified entry point.

# Project Structure

## 1. Project Overview

The Quiz Application is broken down into independent services to improve maintainability, scalability, and deployment flexibility.
The core functionality includes:

Managing a bank of questions

Creating and managing quizzes using those questions

Microservice	Description	Port
service-registry	The Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.	8761
api-gateway	The single entry point for all client requests.	8745
question-service	Manages all CRUD operations for the question bank.	Auto-assigned
quiz-service	Manages quiz creation, fetching questions, and score handling.	Auto-assigned

## 2. Microservices Architecture

Clients make requests only to the API Gateway

API Gateway routes to the appropriate microservice (e.g., quiz-service)

All microservices register themselves with Eureka

Services communicate internally using Feign Clients and logical service names

Example: quiz-service fetches questions from question-service via Eureka

## 3. Technology Stack

Language: Java

Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud

Service Discovery: Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka

API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway

Communication: OpenFeign Client

Build Tool: Maven

## 4. Getting Started
🔧 Prerequisites

JDK 17+

Maven 3.6+

IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

▶️ Setup and Running

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kr254na/Quiz-Application-Backend---Microservices.git
cd quiz-application


Start Service Registry:

cd service-registry
mvn spring-boot:run


Runs on port 8761

Start Question Service:

cd question-service
mvn spring-boot:run


Start Quiz Service:

cd quiz-service
mvn spring-boot:run


Start API Gateway:

cd api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run


Runs on port 8745

## 5. API Documentation

All external API calls must go through the API Gateway (http://localhost:8745).

🔹 API Gateway Endpoints
Prefix	Target Microservice
/question/**	question-service
/quiz/**	quiz-service
🔹 Question Service API

Base Path (via Gateway): http://localhost:8745/question

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/allQuestions	Retrieves all questions
GET	/category/{domain}	Retrieves questions by category/domain
POST	/add	Adds a new question (RequestBody: Question)
PUT	/update	Updates an existing question
DELETE	/delete/{id}	Deletes a question by ID
GET	/generate	Generates list of questions for quiz
POST	/getQuestions	Retrieves questions by IDs
POST	/getScore	Calculates final score for quiz
🔹 Quiz Service API

Base Path (via Gateway): http://localhost:8745/quiz

Method Endpoint	Description
### Creates a quiz
## ( fetches questions from question-service )
```http POST	/create```	
GET	/get/{id}	Gets quiz questions by quiz ID
POST	/submit/{id}	Submits quiz answers and calculates score

## 6. Microservices Concepts & Design
📌 Service Registry (Eureka)

Service Name: service-registry

Port: 8761

Central hub for service discovery

📌 API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)

Service Name: api-gateway

Port: 8745

Single entry point for all client requests

Routes to services dynamically via Eureka

📌 Load Balancing & Inter-Service Communication

Feign Client used for communication

Load balancing automatically handled by Spring Cloud

📌 Scalability and Horizontal Scaling

Each service runs independently

Can deploy multiple instances of high-demand services

Eureka + Gateway + Feign enable dynamic scaling
